# My Play Ground for learning ML models

This is a collection of jupyter notebooks of ML models that I constructed during my self-learning process. They are not for production purposes even though they might with some modifications. 

## Requirements

Jupyter is required since thoses are notebooks. Other requirements may vary depending on each jupyter notebook. I tried to minimize the dependance on third party modules, however, basic packages are still required:
 * torch
 * torchvision
 * matplotlib
 * numpy

Some notebooks were run on CPU on my side, so modifications are needed if you would like to run on other devices.
